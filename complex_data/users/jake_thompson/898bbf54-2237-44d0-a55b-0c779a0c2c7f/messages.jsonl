Graphic Design: Graphic design involves creating visual compositions using shapes, textures, and typography. This medium is great for those who enjoy working with text and visual elements.\n4. Photography: With the rise of smartphone cameras, photography has become more accessible than ever! Beginners can experiment with composition, lighting, and editing to create stunning images.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to choose a medium that resonates with you and your creative style.
