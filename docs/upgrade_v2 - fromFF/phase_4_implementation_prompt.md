## Notes

- This is the final phase - focus on production readiness and completeness
- All previous phases must be working before starting Phase 4
- Security and performance are critical for production deployment
- Documentation must be comprehensive for operational success
- Migration tools are essential for existing FF users
- The system should be ready for production deployment after Phase 4

Please implement Phase 4 following these specifications. This is the final phase that will complete the FF Chat System with full production capabilities. Focus on quality, security, and operational excellence. Let me know when Phase 4 is complete so I can perform final validation of the entire system.
