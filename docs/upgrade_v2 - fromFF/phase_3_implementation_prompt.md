## Performance Considerations

- **Lazy Loading**: Load advanced components only when needed
- **Caching**: Cache expensive operations like tool results and topic classifications
- **Resource Management**: Properly cleanup tools and sandbox resources
- **Async Operations**: Maintain async patterns for all advanced operations
- **Memory Optimization**: Efficiently manage enhanced memory and caching

## Notes

- This is Phase 3 of 4 - focus on advanced professional features
- Phases 1 and 2 must be working before starting Phase 3
- Security is critical for the tools component - implement proper sandboxing
- Enhanced components should extend Phase 2 components, not replace them
- Phase 4 will add the API layer and production deployment features
- Maintain backward compatibility throughout

Please implement Phase 3 following these specifications. Focus on security for the tools component, and ensure all advanced features integrate properly with the existing FF infrastructure. Test each component thoroughly before moving to the next. Let me know when Phase 3 is complete so I can verify the implementation before proceeding to Phase 4.
