**What you'll learn**: File structure and data organization
**Key insight**: Everything is stored as readable JSON/JSONL files

### Section 10: Configuration System Demo
**What it does**: Compares legacy and new configuration approaches
**What you'll learn**: System flexibility and backward compatibility

### Section 11: Performance and Statistics
**What it does**: Shows system metrics and usage statistics
**What you'll learn**: How to monitor and measure system performance

### Section 12: Cleanup (Optional)
**What it does**: Removes demo data
**When to use**: When you're done exploring and want to clean up

## 🛠 Interactive Features

### Modifying Code
- **Click any code cell** to edit it
- **Press Shift+Enter** to run the cell
- **Experiment freely** - you can't break anything!

### Adding Your Own Data
```python
# Example: Add your own user
my_user = UserProfile(
    user_id="your_name",
    username="Your Display Name", 
    preferences={"theme": "light", "notifications": True},
    metadata={"department": "Engineering", "role": "Developer"}
)
# Continue with the existing workflow...
```

### Exploring Results
- **Expand output sections** by clicking on them
- **Scroll through long outputs** to see all results
- **Look for file paths** in outputs to find generated files

## 🔍 What to Look For

### Key Concepts Demonstrated

1. **File-Based Storage**: Notice how everything is stored as files
2. **Human-Readable Format**: All files are JSON/JSONL - you can inspect them
3. **Hierarchical Organization**: Users → Sessions → Messages/Documents
4. **Search Capabilities**: Both text matching and semantic similarity
5. **Configuration Flexibility**: Multiple ways to configure the system

### Understanding the Output

- **✅ Green checkmarks**: Successful operations
- **File paths**: Show where data is stored
- **Statistics**: Show performance and usage metrics
- **Search results**: Demonstrate retrieval capabilities

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

After completing this demo, you should understand:

- ✅ How to set up and configure the Flatfile Chat Database
- ✅ The main API methods for users, sessions, messages, and documents
- ✅ How data is organized in the file system
- ✅ Different search strategies and their trade-offs
- ✅ How to monitor system performance and usage
- ✅ The flexibility of the configuration system

## 🚫 Common Issues and Solutions

### Jupyter Not Starting
```bash
# Try upgrading Jupyter
pip install --upgrade jupyter

# Or use JupyterLab instead
pip install jupyterlab
jupyter lab jupyter_notebook_demo.ipynb
```

### Kernel Issues
```bash
# Install Python kernel
python -m ipykernel install --user --name flatfile-demo

# Then select this kernel in Jupyter: Kernel → Change Kernel
```

### Import Errors
- **Check you're in the right directory**: Should be in `/demo/`
- **Install dependencies**: Run `pip install -r requirements_demo.txt`
- **Check Python version**: Needs Python 3.8+

### Memory Issues
- **Restart kernel**: Kernel → Restart & Clear Output
- **Run cells individually**: Don't run all cells at once
- **Clear demo data**: Run the cleanup section periodically

## 🎨 Customization Ideas

### Add Your Own Data
1. **Replace sample documents** with your own files
2. **Create conversations** about your domain
3. **Test with your user profiles** and metadata

### Experiment with Settings
