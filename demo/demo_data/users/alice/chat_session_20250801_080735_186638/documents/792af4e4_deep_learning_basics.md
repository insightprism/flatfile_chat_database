# Deep Learning Basics

## Neural Networks
Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks. They consist of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons).

### Architecture Components
- **Input Layer**: Receives the input data
- **Hidden Layers**: Process the data through weighted connections
- **Output Layer**: Produces the final prediction

### Activation Functions
- **ReLU**: Rectified Linear Unit, most commonly used
- **Sigmoid**: Outputs values between 0 and 1
- **Tanh**: Outputs values between -1 and 1
- **Softmax**: Used in multi-class classification

### Training Process
1. **Forward Pass**: Input data flows through the network
2. **Loss Calculation**: Compare prediction with actual target
3. **Backward Pass**: Calculate gradients using backpropagation
4. **Weight Update**: Adjust weights using optimization algorithm
