# Transformer Architecture Guide

## Introduction
Transformers have revolutionized natural language processing through their attention mechanism. This guide covers key architectural components and design decisions.

## Core Components

### Multi-Head Attention
The attention mechanism allows models to focus on different parts of the input sequence:

```python
def multi_head_attention(Q, K, V, d_model, num_heads):
    d_k = d_model // num_heads
    # Split into multiple heads
    Q_heads = split_heads(Q, num_heads)
    K_heads = split_heads(K, num_heads) 
    V_heads = split_heads(V, num_heads)
    
    # Apply attention to each head
    attention_outputs = []
    for i in range(num_heads):
        attention_output = scaled_dot_product_attention(
            Q_heads[i], K_heads[i], V_heads[i]
        )
        attention_outputs.append(attention_output)
    
    # Concatenate and project
    concat_output = concatenate(attention_outputs)
    return linear_projection(concat_output)
```

### Position Encodings
Since transformers have no inherent notion of sequence order, position encodings are crucial:

- **Sinusoidal Encodings**: Original approach, works well for most tasks
- **Learned Encodings**: Can be more task-specific but less generalizable
- **Relative Position**: T5-style, better for varying sequence lengths

### Feed-Forward Networks
Each transformer layer includes a position-wise feed-forward network:
- Two linear transformations with ReLU activation
- Dimension is typically 4x the model dimension
- Applied identically to each position

## Architectural Variants

### Encoder-Only (BERT-style)
- Bidirectional context
- Best for understanding tasks
- Uses masked language modeling for pre-training

### Decoder-Only (GPT-style)  
- Autoregressive generation
- Best for generation tasks
- Uses causal masking during training

### Encoder-Decoder (T5-style)
- Combines both approaches
- Flexible for many task types
- Can handle variable input/output lengths

## Design Considerations

### Scaling Laws
Research shows predictable relationships between:
- Model size (parameters)
- Dataset size (tokens)
- Compute budget (FLOPs)
- Final performance

### Efficiency Improvements
- **Sparse Attention**: Reduce O(nÂ²) complexity
- **Mixed Precision**: Use FP16 for training
- **Gradient Checkpointing**: Trade compute for memory
- **Model Parallelism**: Scale beyond single GPU limits

## Best Practices

1. **Layer Normalization**: Pre-norm generally works better than post-norm
2. **Dropout**: Apply to attention weights and feed-forward layers
3. **Learning Rate Scheduling**: Warmup followed by decay
4. **Weight Initialization**: Careful initialization crucial for deep models
5. **Regularization**: Label smoothing, weight decay, dropout

## Recent Advances

### Efficient Attention Mechanisms
- **Linformer**: Linear complexity through low-rank approximation
- **Performer**: Uses random features for linear attention
- **BigBird**: Sparse attention with global, local, and random connections

### Architecture Improvements
- **Switch Transformer**: Sparse expert layers
- **PaLM**: Scaling to 540B parameters
- **GLaM**: Mixture of experts with 1.2T parameters

## Conclusion
Transformer architectures continue to evolve rapidly. Key trends include:
- Scaling to larger sizes
- Improving efficiency
- Adding multimodal capabilities
- Better few-shot learning abilities

The field moves quickly, but understanding these fundamentals provides a solid foundation for working with any transformer variant.
