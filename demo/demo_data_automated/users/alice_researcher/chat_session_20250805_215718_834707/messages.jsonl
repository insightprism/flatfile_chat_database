{"role": "assistant", "content": "That's a smart approach! You could implement a hybrid attention mechanism:\n\n1. **Local Attention**: Process text in sliding windows for detailed linguistic features\n2. **Global Attention**: Use a smaller set of learnable global tokens that attend to the full document\n3. **Cross-Attention**: Let local and global representations interact\n\nFor efficiency, consider:\n- Gradient checkpointing for memory\n- Mixed precision training\n- Attention window sizes that divide evenly into your sequence length\n\nWhat's your target document length?", "message_id": "msg_9f10ad31c347", "timestamp": "2025-08-05T21:57:18.838945", "attachments": [], "metadata": {}}
