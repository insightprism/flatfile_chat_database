    Renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power are 
    becoming increasingly important in the fight against climate change. 
    Solar panels convert sunlight directly into electricity using photovoltaic cells.
    Wind turbines harness kinetic energy from moving air to generate power.
    Hydroelectric dams use the force of flowing water to turn turbines.
    
    The transition to renewable energy requires significant infrastructure 
    investment but offers long-term benefits including reduced carbon emissions,
    energy independence, and sustainable economic growth.
